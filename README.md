# SIR-simulation
## Introduction
The project aims to create a simulation software that predicts the state of individuals in a population upon encountering an infected group. Furthermore, its goal is also to contribute to simulation programs and to automate specific procedures. With several modifications and improvements, we hope that it may have the potential to be utilized for predicting a populationâ€™s rate of infection and recovery in possible future infectious diseases that have characteristics more complicated than the one in this project.
